# 🫁 Lung Cancer Detection using CNN

This application uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to detect lung cancer from DICOM scan data. It includes a user-friendly **Tkinter-based GUI** for importing data, preprocessing, training the model, and displaying results, including predictions and a confusion matrix.

---

## 📦 Features

- GUI interface built using Tkinter  
- Data import from DICOM scans and label CSV  
- Preprocessing of CT scan slices (resizing & averaging)  
- 3D CNN model for cancer classification  
- Displays accuracy, confusion matrix, and patient-wise prediction  
- Interactive buttons for step-by-step control

## 🛠️ Requirements

Install required packages using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas pydicom matplotlib opencv-python tflearn tensorflow==1.15
```

> ⚠️ Note: This project uses **TensorFlow 1.x** via `tf.compat.v1` for compatibility with TFLearn.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Place patient DICOM folders inside `sample_images/`  
2. Ensure `stage1_labels.csv` is present in the project folder  
3. Run the application:

```bash
python lung_cancer_detection.py
```

## 🧠 CNN Model Overview

- Input shape: (10×10×5)
- Architecture:
  - 5× 3D Convolution + MaxPooling layers
  - Fully Connected Layer + Dropout
  - Final Softmax for binary classification

---

## 📊 Output

- Final accuracy on validation set  
- Confusion matrix display  
- Table of predicted vs actual results per patient

---

## 📌 Notes

- Prototype trained on a small set (45 training, 5 validation)
- Performance can improve with more data and tuning
- Not for medical use without proper validation

---

## 👨‍⚕️ Objective

To assist in **early detection** of lung cancer, reduce false positives, and support radiologists in faster diagnosis using deep learning.
